Market Basket Analysis of patient prescriptions

Market Basket Analysis is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to find key associations in customer (or patient) transaction history. Using the Apriori algorithm to create association rules. The key metrics that measure the strength of the associations are support, confidence, and lift. I will look at the confidence values to see the probability of Medication B as a consequence of Medication A. Confidence will help answer the research question: How likely will a patient with a prescription for medication A also be prescribed medication B?
